  "question": "What is the schema of C:/Users/28367/.codex/auth.json and does it support multi-profile data?",

    "path": "Using Path.home() / '.codex' / 'auth.json'; file exists.",
    "content": "{\"OPENAI_API_KEY\":\"sk-...\"}",
    "implication": "Structure is flat key-value; no nested profiles. Writing should preserve top-level dict and just update OPENAI_API_KEY, creating file and parent directory if absent.",
    "compatibility": "Need to guard against JSON decode errors and handle missing key gracefully."
